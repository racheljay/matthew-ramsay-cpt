                What does virtual training look like in 2021? Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Kentucky in March of 2020, virtual training became a well-developed and extremely viable avenue for my client book. Many clients prefer virtual training as they have become more diligent to their goals and find less barriers to training. Others like it because my cats often join in on the coaching, conversation, and activity.

            If you have a device with a camera (such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or computer with a webcam) and some floor space to move around in, then you have everything that is needed for virtual training. Additional accessories that enhance the experience include wireless headphones and a stand/tripod for phones/tablets. Any exercise equipment you have is welcome but certainly not necessary.
